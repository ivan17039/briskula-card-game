# Briškula & Trešeta Card Games

A real-time multiplayer card game platform built with React.js and Socket.io, featuring **Briškula** and **Trešeta** Italian-origin classics beloved across Mediterranean countries in 1v1 and 2v2 modes. These games spread from Italy and have long been part of everyday play in places like Croatia, Montenegro, Slovenia, Spain, and Portugal. Over time, local house rules developed around dealing, drawing, and table talk, yet the core gameplay remains faithful to the original Italian traditions. The app uses the traditional 40‑card Italian deck and lets you enjoy quick matches, longer series, or tournament play online.
